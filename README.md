Wordpress plugin for mapping hate crimes: Leaflet map

This plugin adds a map for showing hate crimes to Wordpress and depends on [Wordpress plugin Hate Crime](https://github.com/geraldo/hatecrimes). Actually it's used for mapping hate crimes at Spain in http://crimenesdeodio.info.

The map is based on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and includes a filter system for showing hate crimes related to a certain category.

It's also possible to show the map without Wordpress using the included index.html file and making reference to a custom [json data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geraldo/hatecrimes-child/master/hatecrimes.js).

There is a live version of the json file for every supported language:
  - [es](http://crimenesdeodio.info/wp-content/export/hatecrimes.es.js).
  - [ca](http://crimenesdeodio.info/wp-content/export/hatecrimes.ca.js).
  - [en](http://crimenesdeodio.info/wp-content/export/hatecrimes.en.js).

Wordpress plugin for mapping hate crimes: Leaflet map

This plugin adds a map for showing hate crimes to Wordpress and depends on [Wordpress plugin Hate Crime](https://github.com/geraldo/hatecrimes). Actually it's used for mapping hate crimes at Spain in http://crimenesdeodio.info.

The map is based on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and includes a filter system for showing hate crimes related to a certain category.

It's also possible to show the map without Wordpress using the included index.html file and making reference to a custom json data source.
